I've been into computers ever since I was young. In fourth grade (according to my friends!) it appeared I had a better handle on computers then our computer teacher did. Around that time I saw the movie 'Hackers' on TV fell in love with the world of technology even more. Sometime after I discovered gaming and rather than continuing to develop my talents I opted to spend my time having fun. Fast forward many years and I am still in love with technology. I've always had an interest in Infosec and I've come to realize that the only person stopping me from getting into it was myself. It's time to fix that.

Posted here will be my journey into the Infosec world in the form of write-ups from Hack The Box and CTFs. I also enjoy 'homelabbing' (because who doesn't need over 100TB of storage and 40Gb ethernet...) and will be sharing some nuggets of knowledge from there as well.
